## Introduction
Based on an analysis of the charging behavior of EV users, this study investigates the configuration of public charging facilities considering different proportions of private charging facilities, taking into account the usage characteristics of different charging methods. Then, the layout, scale, and charging methods of the charging facilities are determined, taking into account the existing resources, in order to meet the travel demand and charging demand as much as possible. The layout, scale, and charging methods of charging facilities are calculated.
