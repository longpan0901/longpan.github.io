## Introduction
In recent years, many major cities in China have been facing serious air pollution problems. Among the many sources of air pollution, traffic emissions from fuel cars have become one of the main sources. In contrast, electric vehicles are attracting attention for their zero pollution, low noise and high energy efficiency, and have become a new direction for low-carbon urban transportation development. 

This study first analyzes the charging demand of electric vehicles in depth and divides the charging behavior into rigid charging demand and flexible charging demand. For rigid charging demand, the trip chain is extracted by using residents' travel data to analyze the daily fixed charging demand; for flexible charging demand, the charging choice behavior is constructed by designing Stated Preference questionnaire survey and based on utility maximization theory. The latent class model is designed to analyze the influence of travel demand characteristics, charging station location, service information, road traffic conditions, road network characteristics, personal attributes, remaining SOC and other potential factors on the path selection behavior of various travelers. Then, on the basis of EV charging demand, the method of EV charging facility layout planning is studied by using site selection theory and combining with EVs' own characteristics (such as path selection behavior, charging time, etc.).
