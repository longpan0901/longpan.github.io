I am currently an [assistant professor](http://faculty.bjtu.edu.cn/trans/9962.html#jybj) at School of Traffic and Transportation, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China. 

I received my PhD in Traffic and Transportation Planning and Management from [Beijing Jiaotong University](http://en.bjtu.edu.cn/). I was a postdoctoral researcher at [Polytechnique Montreal](https://www.polymtl.ca/en/), working with [Professor Owen Waygood](https://www.polymtl.ca/expertises/en/waygood-owen) from Polytechnique Montreal and [Professor Zachary Patterson](https://www.concordia.ca/faculty/zachary-patterson.html) from Concordia University. During this period of time, I am thankful for the working experience at [BusPas Inc.](https://buspas.com/en/).

## My Interests
To build a more harmonious and sustainable transportation system, my research interests include the usage behaviour and configuration optimization of emerging transportation modes such as electric vehicles and shared mobilities, analysis of green travel behavior, and facility layout optimization.
